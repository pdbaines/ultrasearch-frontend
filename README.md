# Ultrasearch Frontend

React frontend for [ultrasearch.io](ultrasearch.io), a place to search for ultramarathons across the globe.

## Overview

This react frontend provides an interface to search and visualize ultramarathon data from across the world.

## Deployment

The application is deployed via [vercel](vercel.com) with DNS and more managed by [Cloudflare](cloudflare.com).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

* `npm start`: runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
* `npm test`: launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
* `npm run build`: builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## Why did you write this?

* ...because I enjoy learning new technologies
* ...because I love running ultramarathons

## Is this it?

No. This is mostly a placeholder. Fancier search, filtering and discovery options will hopefully be added later. Plus, optimizations.
